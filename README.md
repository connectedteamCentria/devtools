# Devtools
*This is a Final Gropu-task from [ConnectedteamCentria/Devtools](https://github.com/connectedteamCentria/devtools)*

***Devtools*** is the Final project in our course Software Development tools. The perpuse of the exercise to understand the software archiecture to real life building acrchiecture and understand the blueprint as well.  

This project was completed by 4 students how were working under [ConnectedteamCentria/Devtools](https://github.com/connectedteamCentria/devtools) as a group member. At the same time we keep tracking Trello which helped us to follow the right track. For the Kanban it is easy to understand the individual task and fix the gole.  

For more details about the program's functionality please check out our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/GdmwY8LR/connectedteam).


# The purpose of the excercise

The purpose of the excercise is to practise agile methologies while creating and presenting a system of animals.

The animals are divided into Wild and Tame and have two activities: MakeSound and Eat.

The tame animals also TalkToOwner and ComeHere. Wild anomals Hunt.

Tame Animals: **Cat**, **Dog**, **Bird** Wild animals: **Bear**, **Wolf**, **Tiger** Exceptional Wild Animal Elefant does not Hunt.


# WILD
![Tiger](https://github.com/connectedteamCentria/devtools/blob/master/Content/tiger.png)

Wild animals are *tiger*, *wolf* and *bear*.

- Make Sound
- Hunt (if an animals hunt succeeds the animal gains 1kg of weight.)


# TAME
![Bird](https://github.com/connectedteamCentria/devtools/blob/master/Content/bird.png)

Tame animals are *bird*, *cat*, *dog* 

- Talk to owner
- Make Sound
- Come to the Owner
- Eat (an animals hians 1kg in weight when eating.)



###The quarterly results look great!
   - Revenue was off the chart.
   - Profits were higher than ever. 
*Everything* is going according to **plan.**

>A blochquote would look great

# Exercise 2

**GENCODE**

**Gencode** is a sciencetific project in [genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome) research and part of the [ENCODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENCODE) (ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements) scale-up project.

The GENCODE consortium was formated as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE project to identify and map all protein-coding genes with in the ENCODE regions(approx. 1% of Human genome).

**SCRIBE (Markup Language)**
**[Scribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe_(markup_language))** is a markup language and [word processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor) system that pioneered the use of [descriptive markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language). Scribe was revolutinonary when it was procesed, because it involved for the first time a clean separation of presentation and content.

**Scribe** was designed and developed by Brian Reid of Carnegie Mellon University. It formed the subject of his 1980 doctoral dissertation, for which he received the Association for computing Machinery's Grace Murray Hopper **Award in 1982.**
